 * A constraint the Issue Form can't express, keyed by field `id`.
 * @typedef {object} Rule
 * @property {number} [minLength] - Prose length floor (hard).
 * @property {number} [maxLength] - Prose length ceiling (warning).
 * @property {boolean} [checklist] - Field must be a markdown checklist.
 * @property {number} [minItems] - Minimum non-empty checklist items.
 * @property {string[]} [blocking] - Dropdown options too big to land as one issue.
 * @property {boolean} [warnIfEmpty] - Optional field whose absence is a warning,
 *   not a silent pass: recommended context an implementer shouldn't have to guess.
