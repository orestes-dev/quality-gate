// The TTY prompt that asks which scaffolds to add (ADR 0016).
//
// Isolated from `selection.js` so the precedence rules stay testable with a plain
// function stub and no terminal. This module is the only place `@clack/prompts` is
// imported: the dependency budget for prompting is the CLI surface alone, never
// the vendored git hooks, which keep their POSIX sh + jq budget so they run before
// any install (ADR 0015).
//
// `@clack/prompts` is pinned exactly. `npx`-from-git resolves the CLI's
// dependencies with no lockfile, so an exact pin is the only thing standing
// between a consumer and whatever the range would float to on the day they run it.
