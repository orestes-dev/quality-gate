# quality-gate

A deterministic quality gate for GitHub issues and pull requests, so work lands
well-scoped and actionable. Structural checks only: title format, presence,
length, checklist count, size enum. The **issue gate** is advisory (labels +
scorecard, never fails CI); the **PR gate** hard-fails CI so a red check blocks
merge. Both are two callers of one shared core; see the [PR gate](#pull-request-gate)
section and [`CONTEXT.md`](CONTEXT.md).

## Features

- **Deterministic checks**: Conventional Commits title, presence, min/max
  length, acceptance-criteria checklist count, size enum. Same rules every time.
- **Scorecard comment**: every run upserts one **Issue Quality Checklist** with
  a ✅ / ⚠️ / ❌ line per check, so a clean issue gets confirmation, not silence.
- **Three mutually-exclusive labels**: `issue-quality:failing` (hard block),
  `issue-quality:warning` (non-blocking), `issue-quality:pass`, a filterable
  signal for downstream automation.
- **Manual override**: a labelled escape hatch with a required written rationale.
- **One-command opt-in**: `npx github:orestes-dev/quality-gate init` drops
  the Issue Form + PR Form and their workflows, and prints a Suggested rule to
  paste into your agent rules; no per-repo config.
- **Shared pre-flight validator**: run the same checks locally before
  `gh issue create`.

## What it checks

The fields and their headings are owned by the Issue Form
([`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/task.yml`](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/task.yml)) and read
from it at runtime; the table below is the human-readable bar for the rules
layered on top.

| Field                             | Rule                                          | Severity                 |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Title**                         | Conventional Commits `type(scope): summary`   | error                    |
| **Context**                       | present, ≥ 30 chars                           | error                    |
| **Context**                       | ≤ 1500 chars                                  | warning (fluff detector) |
| **Acceptance Criteria**           | ≥ 1 non-empty checklist item (`- [ ]`)        | error                    |
| **Out of Scope**                  | present, ≥ 10 chars                           | error                    |
| **Decisions**                     | present (settled choices + rationale)         | warning if empty         |
| **Affected files / entry points** | present (files/symbols the work touches)      | warning if empty         |
| **Depends on**                    | optional (prerequisite issues / merge order)  | none                     |
| **Size**                          | one of `XS / S / M / L / XL`                  | error                    |
| **Size**                          | not `L` / `XL` (too big to land as one issue) | error                    |

Title is issue metadata, not a body section, so it leads the scorecard rather
than being derived from the form. Decisions and Affected files are optional but
recommended: empty raises a non-blocking warning, since both sharpen an issue
for whoever (human or agent) implements it.

The worst per-check status sets one mutually-exclusive label:

| Outcome               | Label                   |
| --------------------- | ----------------------- |
| ≥ 1 error             | `issue-quality:failing` |
| 0 errors, ≥ 1 warning | `issue-quality:warning` |
| clean                 | `issue-quality:pass`    |

Every run upserts the scorecard comment, an override included: no run ever
leaves an issue without one.

### Issue Quality Checklist

- ✅ **Title**: feat(search): debounce the query input
- ✅ **Context**: present (118 chars)
- ✅ **Acceptance Criteria**: 2 checklist items
- ❌ **Out of Scope**: missing or empty
- ⚠️ **Decisions**: recommended; add it so implementers aren't left guessing
- ✅ **Affected files / entry points**: present (28 chars)
- ✅ **Depends on**: optional; not provided
- ✅ **Size**: S
```

### Override

Set `override:issue-quality` **and** add a non-empty `## Override rationale`
section to bypass: the quality label is stripped, but the scorecard stays and
leads with a banner acknowledging the bypass, so the record of what the gate
found survives the override. The label without a rationale does not bypass; it
raises a warning to write one.

## Consuming the gate's output

The labels are a filterable signal for downstream automation (or a saved search).
An issue is **ready for pickup** when the gate cleared it or a human waived the
block: `issue-quality:pass`, `issue-quality:warning` (non-blocking by design), or
`override:issue-quality`. Query readiness as a positive union of those labels:

```text
is:issue is:open label:issue-quality:pass,issue-quality:warning,override:issue-quality
```

GitHub OR's comma-separated `label:` terms, so this matches any of the three.
Filter to only pristine issues by dropping the last two terms; that is a
stricter-than-ready policy a consumer opts into, not the default meaning of ready.

Do **not** express readiness as `-label:issue-quality:failing`. The negative form
also matches issues the gate never evaluated (opened before CI ran, a repo not
opted in, a run still in flight), which carry no quality label at all. Readiness
requires an affirmative signal that the gate reached a verdict, so always list the
ready labels explicitly.

## Opting a repo in

```sh
npx github:orestes-dev/quality-gate init
```

Run from the repo root. This drops four files, which together are the opt-in:

- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/task.yml`: the Issue Form (canonical schema).
- `.github/workflows/issue-quality.yml`: a thin workflow calling the shared
  Action at `@main` for the issue gate.
- `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`: the PR Form (required sections).
- `.github/workflows/pr-quality.yml`: a thin workflow calling the shared Action
  at `@main` for the PR gate (merge-blocking).

Commit all four. `init` then prints a Suggested rule to stdout: an agent-guidance
snippet naming both Forms and the matching pre-flight `validate` / `validate-pr`
step, for you to paste into your own agent-rules file (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`,
editor rules). `init` writes it to no file, so it never clobbers a file it does
not own.

Re-running `init` later is safe: unchanged files are left alone. If a bundled
template has moved on and your copy is stale (or you edited it locally), `init`
writes nothing and exits 1, listing what drifted. Re-run `init --force` to
overwrite the drifted files in place; since they are committed, `git diff`
afterwards shows exactly what changed and lets you restore any local edits.

CI runs on `issues: opened` / `edited` always, and on `labeled` /
`unlabeled` only when a human touches `override:issue-quality` or an
`issue-quality:*` label. The gate's own label writes (as the CI bot) are
excluded, so it never re-triggers itself; a human hand-editing a quality label
re-runs it, so manual changes self-heal.

Blank or freeform issues (any `gh issue create` body) skip the form and land as
`issue-quality:failing`, so nothing bypasses the gate. To stop blank issues
entirely, add `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml` with
`blank_issues_enabled: false` yourself.

The gate labels issues going forward, from the first event on each. To label the
existing backlog too, run [`sweep`](#backfilling-the-backlog) once after opting
in.

## Backfilling the backlog

Opt-in is going-forward only: an existing issue is validated the next time it is
edited, so an untouched backlog stays unlabeled. To backfill on demand, run:

```sh
npx github:orestes-dev/quality-gate sweep
```

`sweep` labels + scorecards every **open** issue that has no `issue-quality:*`
label yet, running each through the same gate the CI action does. It takes no
flags: it reads credentials from `gh auth token` and the target repo from
`gh repo view`, so run it inside an authenticated clone of the repo.

- **Idempotent and re-runnable.** Already-labeled issues are filtered out server
  side, so they are never touched or re-notified; only unlabeled issues are
  swept. Re-running only picks up new arrivals.
- **Resilient.** A failure on one issue is reported and the sweep continues; the
  run exits non-zero if any issue failed, so you can re-run to retry just those.
- **Backlogs over 1000.** GitHub caps issue search at 1000 results. Because
  sweeping labels an issue (dropping it from the query), `sweep` prints a notice
  when more remain; re-run until it stops.

Labels are created on first use with intentional colors and descriptions, so
`sweep` (or the first CI run) also materializes the three `issue-quality:*`
labels in the repo; there is no separate label-setup step.

## Pre-flight validation

Before `gh issue create`, run the same validator on a draft file. Pass
`--title` to also check the title against the Conventional Commits format:

```sh
npx github:orestes-dev/quality-gate validate path/to/issue-body.md \
  --title "feat(search): debounce the query input"
```

The file must use the same `### ` headings the Issue Form renders (Decisions,
Affected files, and Depends on are optional):

```md
### Context

<what needs to happen and why>

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] <verifiable outcome>

### Out of Scope

- <explicit non-goal>

### Decisions

- <settled choice: rationale>

### Affected files / entry points

- <path/to/file: symbol>

### Size

S
```

Exits non-zero on errors. One validator backs both CI and pre-flight. Without
`--title` the title check is skipped (a body file carries no title).

```

## Pull request gate

A second entry point runs the same core over a pull request on `pull_request`
events. It checks structural presence, never conformance:

- **Title**: Conventional Commits `type(scope): summary`, same rule as issues.
- **Required sections**: `## Summary` and `## Verification` present and
  non-empty.
- **Divergence**: the `## Divergence` section is optional until its checkbox is
  checked. A checked flag with no written rationale hard-fails; unchecked (or
  checked with a rationale) passes. The gate checks the rationale is present,
  never whether the code conforms to the issue.
- **Linked-issue readiness**: every issue the PR closes (GitHub's native
  `closingIssuesReferences`, from `Closes #N` or the Development sidebar) must be
  ready, the same `issue-quality:pass` / `warning` / `override:issue-quality`
  union a consumer uses to pick up an issue. A PR that closes zero same-repo
  issues hard-fails, since each closed issue is a spec it claims to satisfy.
  Cross-repo links are ignored (the token can't read another repo's labels) and
  the scorecard says so. The check re-runs only on PR events, so when a linked
  issue flips to ready afterward the scorecard tells you to re-run it.

The PR structure is defined by a code descriptor (`src/pr-validator.js`), the
source of truth the Markdown template is drift-tested against. Any error (a
missing section, a non-conventional title) **hard-fails CI**, turning the check
red and blocking merge; warnings stay green. Outcomes carry exactly one of
`pr-quality:pass` / `pr-quality:warning` / `pr-quality:failing` plus an upserted
**PR Quality Checklist** scorecard, both diff-based like the issue gate.

Bot-authored PRs (actor login ends in `[bot]`) auto-pass with no override, since
no human is present to apply one. A human bypasses with `override:pr-quality`
plus a `## Override rationale` section, mirroring the issue override. The
consumer workflow lives in
[`templates/pr-workflow.yml`](templates/pr-workflow.yml) and needs
`permissions: pull-requests: write`.

## Notes

- **`@main`, unpinned.** Consumers reference `orestes-dev/quality-gate@main`,
  so rule changes propagate on the next run with no per-repo bump, accepting
  that a bad change affects every opted-in repo at once.
- **Fixed schema.** No per-repo config or inputs, so the labels mean the same
  thing in every repo. The gate reads structure from its own checkout, not your
  copy of the form, so the scaffolded `task.yml` is not meant to be edited:
  renaming a heading or changing the size options makes submitted issues stop
  matching, and every one is marked failing.

## Architecture

Structure is read from the Issue Form at runtime; rules the form can't express
live in `src/rules.js`. [`CONTEXT.md`](CONTEXT.md) is the domain glossary:
Issue Form, structure, field, section, rule, check, scorecard, override.
