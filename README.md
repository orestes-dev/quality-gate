# issue-quality-gate

A deterministic quality gate for GitHub issues, so they land well-scoped and
actionable. Structural checks only: presence, length, checklist count, size
enum.

## Features

- **Deterministic checks**: presence, min/max length, acceptance-criteria
  checklist count, size enum. Same rules every time.
- **Scorecard comment**: every run upserts one **Issue Quality Checklist** with
  a ✅ / ⚠️ / ❌ line per check, so a clean issue gets confirmation, not silence.
- **Three mutually-exclusive labels**: `issue-quality:failing` (hard block),
  `issue-quality:warning` (non-blocking), `issue-quality:pass`, a filterable
  signal for downstream automation.
- **Manual override**: a labelled escape hatch with a required written rationale.
- **One-command opt-in**: `npx github:orestes-dev/issue-quality-gate init` drops
  the Issue Form + workflow; no per-repo config.
- **Shared pre-flight validator**: run the same checks locally before
  `gh issue create`.

## What it checks

The fields and their headings are owned by the Issue Form
([`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/task.yml`](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/task.yml)) and read
from it at runtime; the table below is the human-readable bar for the rules
layered on top.

| Field                   | Rule                                          | Severity                 |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Context**             | present, ≥ 30 chars                           | error                    |
| **Context**             | ≤ 1500 chars                                  | warning (fluff detector) |
| **Acceptance Criteria** | ≥ 1 non-empty checklist item (`- [ ]`)        | error                    |
| **Out of Scope**        | present, ≥ 10 chars                           | error                    |
| **Size**                | one of `XS / S / M / L / XL`                  | error                    |
| **Size**                | not `L` / `XL` (too big to land as one issue) | error                    |

The worst per-check status sets one mutually-exclusive label:

| Outcome               | Label                   |
| --------------------- | ----------------------- |
| ≥ 1 error             | `issue-quality:failing` |
| 0 errors, ≥ 1 warning | `issue-quality:warning` |
| clean                 | `issue-quality:pass`    |

Every run upserts the scorecard comment (removed only by a completed override):

```md
### Issue Quality Checklist

- ✅ **Context**: present (118 chars)
- ✅ **Acceptance Criteria**: 2 checklist items
- ❌ **Out of Scope**: missing or empty
- ✅ **Size**: S
```

### Override

Set `override:issue-quality` **and** add a non-empty `## Override rationale`
section to bypass: all quality labels and the comment are stripped. The label
without a rationale does not bypass; it raises a warning to write one.

## Opting a repo in

```sh
npx github:orestes-dev/issue-quality-gate init
```

Run from the repo root. This drops two files, which together are the opt-in:

- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/task.yml`: the Issue Form (canonical schema).
- `.github/workflows/issue-quality.yml`: a thin workflow calling the shared
  Action at `@main`.

Commit both. CI runs on `issues: opened` / `edited` always, and on `labeled` /
`unlabeled` only when a human touches `override:issue-quality` or an
`issue-quality:*` label. The gate's own label writes (as the CI bot) are
excluded, so it never re-triggers itself; a human hand-editing a quality label
re-runs it, so manual changes self-heal.

Blank or freeform issues (any `gh issue create` body) skip the form and land as
`issue-quality:failing`, so nothing bypasses the gate. To stop blank issues
entirely, add `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml` with
`blank_issues_enabled: false` yourself.

The gate labels issues going forward, from the first event on each. To label the
existing backlog too, run [`sweep`](#backfilling-the-backlog) once after opting
in.

## Backfilling the backlog

Opt-in is going-forward only: an existing issue is validated the next time it is
edited, so an untouched backlog stays unlabeled. To backfill on demand, run:

```sh
npx github:orestes-dev/issue-quality-gate sweep
```

`sweep` labels + scorecards every **open** issue that has no `issue-quality:*`
label yet, running each through the same gate the CI action does. It takes no
flags: it reads credentials from `gh auth token` and the target repo from
`gh repo view`, so run it inside an authenticated clone of the repo.

- **Idempotent and re-runnable.** Already-labeled issues are filtered out server
  side, so they are never touched or re-notified; only unlabeled issues are
  swept. Re-running only picks up new arrivals.
- **Resilient.** A failure on one issue is reported and the sweep continues; the
  run exits non-zero if any issue failed, so you can re-run to retry just those.
- **Backlogs over 1000.** GitHub caps issue search at 1000 results. Because
  sweeping labels an issue (dropping it from the query), `sweep` prints a notice
  when more remain; re-run until it stops.

Labels are created on first use with intentional colors and descriptions, so
`sweep` (or the first CI run) also materializes the three `issue-quality:*`
labels in the repo; there is no separate label-setup step.

## Pre-flight validation

Before `gh issue create`, run the same validator on a draft file:

```sh
npx github:orestes-dev/issue-quality-gate validate path/to/issue-body.md
```

The file must use the same `### ` headings the Issue Form renders:

```md
### Context

<what needs to happen and why>

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] <verifiable outcome>

### Out of Scope

- <explicit non-goal>

### Size

S
```

Exits non-zero on errors. One validator backs both CI and pre-flight.

    A[issue opened / edited / labeled / unlabeled] --> B[fetch issue fresh from API]

    C -->|no| E[validate: presence, length, AC checklist, size]
    E --> F[label by worst status + upsert scorecard comment] --> Z
```

## Notes

- **`@main`, unpinned.** Consumers reference `orestes-dev/issue-quality-gate@main`,
  so rule changes propagate on the next run with no per-repo bump, accepting
  that a bad change affects every opted-in repo at once.
- **Fixed schema.** No per-repo config or inputs, so the labels mean the same
  thing in every repo. The gate reads structure from its own checkout, not your
  copy of the form, so the scaffolded `task.yml` is not meant to be edited:
  renaming a heading or changing the size options makes submitted issues stop
  matching, and every one is marked failing.
- **Going-forward only.** Opt-in does not auto-backfill; existing issues are
  validated when next edited. Run [`sweep`](#backfilling-the-backlog) to label
  the current backlog on demand.

## Architecture

Structure comes from the Issue Form (`task.yml`, parsed at runtime); rules the
form can't express live in `src/schema.js`.
